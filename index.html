<h1>Ellen's hobbies</h1>
<p>Some of my hobbies include writing, reading, music composition, exercise, playing various instruments, and doing random activities with friends. Currently, I'm simultaneously writing a novel and composing/directing/writing/producing a musical. I enjoy writing in any form of media. Currently, I've been loving playwriting, but I love writing novels, short stories, poems, academic essays, and, of course, songs.</p>

<h2>Ellen's career goals</h2>
<p>My carreer goals are to be in something <strong>creative.</strong> I believe God has given me the gift of creativity and I couldn't fathom being in a career without it. Ideally, I'd love to be a writer, either for musicals, songs, or novels, but overall I'd find any career in which I can reach out to people creatively and touch the hearts of my consumers fulfilling. Overall, my primary goal is to be God-honoring and use my Godly gifts to the best of my abilities to spread His love to all.</p>
