<h1>Marilyn Monroe</h1>
  <p>I love Marilyn Monroe so much. Although she was mostly regarded for her looks and quite frankly, she is very beautiful, she's also a very talented actress--both on and off screen. She was able to convince the world she was a dumb blonde bimbo so acting agencies, photographers, etc. all took her as one. Thus, making her an easy hire in which she holds complete control while convincing her employers they have control over her. Of course, she has full agency for the raunchy decisions she made, but that isn't to say the movie and fashion industry didn't fail her by requiring her to act as a blonde bimbo in order to make a living.
